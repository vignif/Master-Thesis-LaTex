\chapter{Closed Loop controllers}
A closed loop control is considered potentially successful for obtaining consensus in the human-robot handshaking. Different models can explain the relation between $q$ and $F_{h}$, therefore different controllers have been tested.
These controllers can shape the $q_{ref}$ with respect to the $F_{h}$ with different relations outcomes of experiments described in \ref{sec:pseudo}. 
Each participant has a different handsize, therefore $q0$ is not constant, this means that the position at which the Pisa/IIT SoftHand realize a contact for the first time changes.
A method used in order to find a single fitted equation capable of explaining these offsets in the position, is to shift the values $q_{ref,i}$ of $q_{0,i}$. The reference position of the $i-th$ participant is shifted by the $q_{0}$ of the same participant. The relation \ref{EQ:genericForce} can be applied considering that the term $q_{0}-q_{ref}$
